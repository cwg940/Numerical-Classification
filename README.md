# Numerical Classification with Raspberry Pi 3, Keras, and OpenCV
`stream.py` allows the ability to classify numbers in real time using the Raspberry Pi's PiCamera accessory. The classifier itself, `KerasCNN.h5`, is a convolutional neural network build with Keras using Theano trained using the MNIST dataset.
