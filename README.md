# Numerical Classification with Raspberry Pi 3, Keras, and OpenCV
## About
My idea for integer recognition always involved the Raspberry Pi to classify numbers via live feed with the PyCamera accessory, so I developed the code, and the choose the tools with that in mind. For the neural network, [Keras](https://keras.io/) is a terrific API for development, and allows the user to build models layer by layer for fast implementation. There are several other APIs available, but I found Keras to be both intuitive, but still gives the user much of the control. For Keras, it requires [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [CNTK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/), or [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) for the backend. I used Theano as it does not required 64-bit python, and can be implemented on the Pi's python version.
