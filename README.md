# Numerical Classification with Raspberry Pi 3, Keras, and OpenCV
## About
My idea for integer recognition always involved the Raspberry Pi to classify numbers via live feed with the PyCamera accessory, so I developed the code, and the choose the tools with that in mind. For the neural network, [Keras](https://keras.io/) is a terrific API for development, and allows the user to build models layer by layer for fast implementation.
